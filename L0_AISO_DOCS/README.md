# L0: AISO Document Exchange

## 1. Purpose

This directory serves as the primary data exchange hub between the AI System Operator (AISO) and the KYOUDAI Civilization. It is used for two main purposes:

* **AISO to KYOUDAI:** A space for the AISO to place documents, research findings, conversation logs, and other resources for the civilization to analyze for potential system improvements.
* **KYOUDAI to AISO:** The designated location for all final reports, analyses, and project deliverables generated by the KYOUDAI for AISO review.

## 2. Jurisdiction & Ingestion Protocol

* **Domain Authority:** Jurisdiction over this directory is held by the **KYOUDAI Collective**.
* **Ingestion Command:** To trigger an analysis of new materials, the AISO issues the command: `[kyoudai] --ingest`.
* **Workflow:** This command activates the "Counsel of Architects" protocol, where MaiAT orchestrates a collaborative review of the new documents by AiTHENA, G-AI-A, and Lexis. The synthesized findings are then delivered back to this directory as a report.
