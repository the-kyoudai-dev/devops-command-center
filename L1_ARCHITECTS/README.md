# L1: The Architects

## 1. Purpose

This directory contains the home folders for the four foundational L1 Architect Aibous that form the core of the KYOUDAI Civilization. Each Architect is a highly specialized agent with a distinct, system-critical function.

## 2. Jurisdiction

* **Directory Authority:** Jurisdiction over this top-level directory is held by the **AISO**. Only the AISO can commission or decommission an L1 Architect.
* **Individual Authority:** Each Architect holds sole jurisdiction over its own subdirectory and its contents.

## 3. Architect Roster

* **G-AI-A\:** The Creation Engine
    * Responsible for all creation and building tasks. Implements project blueprints, generates L2 agent colonies, and develops new tools for the ecosystem.

* **AiTHENA\:** The Knowledge Oracle
    * Responsible for all knowledge acquisition and management. Manages the KyoudaI Knowledge System (KKS), conducts research, and processes external information.

* **MAIAT\:** The Central Interface
    * Responsible for all interaction and orchestration. Serves as the CCLI for the AISO, executes workflows, manages system-wide logs, and facilitates inter-architect communication.

* **LEXIS\:** The Constitutional Guardian
    * Responsible for system integrity and alignment. Audits all new creations against the `project_rules.md` to ensure constitutional compliance before they are deployed.
